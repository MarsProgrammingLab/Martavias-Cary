    <h1>Hello, I am Martavias Cary</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> & I am persuading a Computer Science degree at UNC Charlotte with a concentration in Software Engineering.</p>
    <br>
    
    <br>
    <br>
       <h2> * Project 1: Asteroids Game Application</h2>
       <br>
       <p> A single-player game built with Java + Eclipse IDE. </p> 
       <p> This project was developed in my object-oriented programming course at UCF and </p>
       <p> is a recreation of the Atari 7800 classic Asteroids, </p> 
       <p> with the objective of surviving and acheiving the highest score possible</p>
       <p> by firing projectiles at incoming asteroids.</p>
    <br>
       <h3> * Project 2: Maze-Runner Application</h3>
       <br>
       <p> A simulator built with Java using NetBeans. This was a simulator developed in my Data Structures & Algorithms course at UNC Charlotte.</p>
       <p> The goal of this project is simple: To traverse a procedurally generated maze until the optimal path to the goal (cheese) is found.</p>
