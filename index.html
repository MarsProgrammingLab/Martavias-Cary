    <h1>Martavias - Portfolio </h1>
    <p> I am pursuing a Computer Science degree at UNC Charlotte</p>
        <p>with a concentration in Software Engineering and </p>
            <p>Minor in Mathematics.</p>
    <br>

       <h2> * Project 1: Asteroids Game Application</h2>
       <br>
       <p> A single-player game built with Java & Eclipse IDE. </p> 
       <p> This project was developed in my Object-Oriented Programming</p> 
           <p>course at UCF and is a re-creation of the Atari 7800 classic</p>
           <p>Asteroids. The objective of the game is surviving and acheiving </p>
       <p> the highest score possible by firing projectiles at</p>
       <p>  incoming asteroids.</p>
    <br>
       <h3> * Project 2: Maze-Runner Application</h3>
       <br>
       <p> A simulator built with Java using NetBeans.</p> 
       <p>This was a simulator developed in my Data Structures</p> 
       <p>& Algorithms course at UNC Charlotte.</p>
       <p> The goal of this project is to traverse a</p>
           <p>procedurally generated maze until the correct path to the </p>
               <p>goal (cheese) is found.</p>
       <br>
       <h4>* Project 3: Scientific Calculator using Python</h4>
       <p>A simple calculator written in Python. 
           <p>This project was developed in my Software</p> 
           Engineering Course at UNC Charlotte.</p>
       <p>This is a calculator that can perform multiplication, </p>
           <p>addition, subtraction, and division along with 
               <p>trigonometric functions and exponents. </p>
