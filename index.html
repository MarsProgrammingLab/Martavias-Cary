       <p> * Project 1: Asteroids Game Application</p>
       <br>
       <p> * * A single-player game built with Java + Eclipse IDE. </p> 
       <p> * * This project was developed in my object-oriented programming course at UCF. </p>
       <p> * * This project was a recreation of the Atari 7800 classic Asteroids, </p> 
       <p> * * with the goal of this game beingthe player trying to acheive the highest score possible</p>
       <p> * * by firing projectiles at incoming asteroids.</p>
    <br>
       <p> * Project 2: Maze-Runner Application</p>
       <br>
       <p> * * A simulator built with Java using NetBeans. This was a simulator developed in my Data Structures & Algorithms at UNC Charlotte.</p>
       <p> * * The goal of this project is simple: To traverse a procedurally generated maze until the optimal path to the goal (cheese) is found.</p>
